A script to run daily to find the new bottle offerings from QBB in Mountain View.

TODO:
- [x] setup cron job
- [ ] refactor and clean up
- [ ] more precise length counts to show more bottles in message
- [ ] possibly check updated time and compare to short circuit the job
- [x] send notification if no contents found (if markup changes)
